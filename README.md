# Disney Dataset Analysis

## Introduction

The Disney dataset from Kaggle is a comprehensive dataset that provides detailed information about Disney movies and TV shows[^1^][1]. It's an excellent resource for data analysis and visualization, offering insights into Disney's content.

## Objectives

The main objective of this project was to analyze the Disney dataset and extract meaningful insights using Excel for data preprocessing and Power BI for data visualization. The project aimed to understand patterns in Disney's content, such as common themes, character appearances, and more.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Loading**: The first step was to load the Disney dataset into Excel.
2. **Data Cleaning**: This involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistent entries using Excel's data cleaning features.
3. **Data Preparation**: After preprocessing the data in Excel, it was loaded into Power BI for further analysis. This included creating relationships between tables and adding calculated columns or measures as needed.
4. **Data Visualization**: Various charts and graphs were created in Power BI to visualize the data and uncover patterns and trends.
5. **Dashboard Creation**: An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to present the findings in a user-friendly manner.

## Learnings

Through this project, I gained valuable experience in data preprocessing with Excel and data visualization with Power BI. I learned how to use Excel's powerful data cleaning features and Power BI's robust visualization tools to analyze data and draw insights. I also understood the importance of data visualization in making data-driven decisions.

## Conclusion

The Excel and Power BI project on the Disney dataset was a great learning experience. It provided insights into the structure and content of Disney's movies and TV shows, which could be valuable for understanding patterns in the entertainment industry.
